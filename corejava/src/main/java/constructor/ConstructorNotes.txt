What is Constructor?
Is a Special type of method used for initializing Objects of a class.
Also initializes variables of the class with default values.

Constructor vs Method
Constructor does not have return type.
Constructor name and class name must be same.
When we create an object of a class, Constructor will get called automatically.

Imp  =>>>> When we(developer) doesn't provide any Constructor in class, JVM will provide default Constructor.
Imp  =>>>> When developer writes arg constructor then JVM won't provide you default constructor and dev needs
            to write no-arg constructor.

no-arg constructor(Developer) vs default constructor(JVM)

Types of Constructor
1) User defined
    A. Arg constructor // parameterized constructor
    B. No Arg constructor //non parameterized constructor
2) default constructor
