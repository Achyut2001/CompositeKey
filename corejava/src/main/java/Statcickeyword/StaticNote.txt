What is static?
static is non-access modifier.

Note: We don't need to create an Object of a class, to access static method.
       We can access static methods using class name.



Why we use static?
When we want to share same copy with all the Objects of a class, we mark it as a static.

Whatever static it belongs to whole class and not specific object.

For instance variable, each object will get his own copy.


Types of variables
1) static
2) instance
3) local
